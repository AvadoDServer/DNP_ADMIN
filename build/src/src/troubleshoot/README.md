# Troubleshoot

Auto-support tool to help identify error causes. Provides generic solutions to common problems after performing a list of routine checks. It also prepopulates a github issue with that DAppNode's particular system info to aid in the support proccess. All info is shown to the admin beforehand and is not sent anywhere without the explicit action of the admin.
